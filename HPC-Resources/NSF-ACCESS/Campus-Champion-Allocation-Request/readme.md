# Campus Champion Allocation Request

This page is specific to Campus Champions.

The mission of the Campus Champions is to foster a dynamic environment for a diverse community of research computing and data professionals sharing knowledge and experience in digital research infrastructure.

Campus Champions, through NSF ACCESS, have HPC allocations intended to allow researchers on their campus to quickly try out a cluster.
