# What are Campus Champions?

Campus Champions are cyberinfrastructure professionals and are employees or affiliates of a college, university, or research institution, who help the institution’s community with computing and data-intensive research.

Champions help with research, education, scholarship, and/or creative activity, and help users to adopt advanced digital capabilities to improve, grow, and accelerate these achievements.

Campus Champions include professional roles such as system administrators, outreach coordinators, research facilitators, engineers, researchers, students, and more, collectively strengthening cyberinfrastructure worldwide.

## What do they do?

For over 18 years, the Campus Champions have been building an ever-growing, diverse and multi-disciplinary, research computing-centric collection of knowledge in support of the national research community.

Their community is bonded in the mission to facilitate computational and data-intensive research and help researchers find and use the technologies that best fit their needs at whatever scale necessary.

Campus Champions, through NSF ACCESS, have HPC allocations intended to allow researchers on their campus to quickly try out a cluster.

This page provides new campus champions with a tutorial on requesting an allocation and using it to help with campus researchers. 

- [Create an ACCESS account](./../create-nsf-access-account.md/)
- [Request an allocation](./../allocation-request.md/) to get ACCESS credits
  - For Campus Champions, the DISCOVER level is the most suitable one.
  - In step 5 -> 'Opportunity Questions' -> 2 Association with activities: check mark “Campus Champion” along with other relevant activities
  - In step 5 -> 'Documents and Publications' -> Refer to the example campus champion allocation request written in an NSF template
