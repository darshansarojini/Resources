Spend NSF ACCESS credits with resource providers to get access to the HPC resource.

- [List of resource providers](https://allocations.access-ci.org/resources)
- [Conversion rate](https://allocations.access-ci.org/exchange_calculator)

## How to pick which resource you want:

As an example, I exchanged ACCESS credits for core-hours on the [PSC-Bridges-2 HPC cluster](https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/).

### Steps:

1. Login to your ACCESS account.
2. On the homepage click “Manage Allocation”.
3. From the drop-down menu click “Manage my projects”.
4. Click the “Choose New Action” button.
5. From the drop-down menu click “Exchange”.
    - Your available ACCESS credits will be displayed. A drop-down menu will show all available resource providers.
6. Choose the resource you want. I chose “PSC Bridges-2 Regular Memory (Bridges-2)”. Click “Add Resource”.
    - I received a message: “PSC Bridges-2 Regular Memory (Bridges-2) requires PSC Bridges-2 Storage (Ocean).” Two resources were added: the compute node and the storage.
7. Enter the “Desired Balance” for both. I entered 1000 core-hours and 50GB of storage.
8. Enter comments related to your request.
9. Click Submit.
